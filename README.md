# The 100 Queries Project

In 2023, [Maarten Sprenger](https://github.com/Maaspr) and [Carsten Schnober](https://github.com/carschno) investigated the Google search results for 100 queries by elementary school students.

Our goals:
1. gather insights about available information on the web
2. design a model to analyse and discuss the quality of internet information systematically.

This [notebook](https://github.com/SlimZoeken/100queries/blob/main/notebooks/analysis.ipynb) shows the raw data analyses.
